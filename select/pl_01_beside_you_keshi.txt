It's just you and I,
and no other guys
We got no interruptions
and we both feelin' the vibe
Say I'm not your type
But I know what's on your mind
We can talk about nothin' or
we can see what it's like
Don't lie, baby don't lie
His love never felt right
Switch sides and I'm beside you
If you say it's alright
(Don't lie, baby don't lie)
Way too many heads,
need a steady view
Smokin' cigarettes
at the rendezvous
Never meant to cross you
But my jaw hit the floor
with the one, two
Think I want you
You say this ain't love
but it's still the same love
Make love, anything to sate ya
Don't be shy, you decide
Say can I, make you mine?
Don't lie, baby don't lie
His love never felt right
Switch sides and I'm beside ya
If you say it's alright
(lemme show you
how it feel like)
Don't lie, baby don't lie
His love never felt right
Switch sides and I'm beside ya
If you say it's alright
(Don't lie, baby don't lie)
(Ahh) Your skin, so fine
(Ah-ahh, ahh)
Come close baby put it on mine
(Ahh) Your skin, so fine
(Ah-ahh, ahh)
Come close baby put it on mine
It's just you
and I and no other guys
We got no interruptions
and we both feelin' the vibe
Say I'm not your type
But I know what's on your mind
We can talk about nothin' or
we can see what it's like
No-ohh-ohh, yeah-yeah-yeah
Don't lie, baby don't lie
His love never felt right
Switch sides
and I'm beside ya
(Ahh)
If you say it's alright
(Ah-ahh, ahh)
(Lemme show you
what it feel like)
(Don't lie, baby don't lie)
