You were always quiet
I was always cold
Walking there beside you
Promises were gold

So I moved a little closer
But you took a step away
And the world that was
Between us has gone away

Now a new voice guides me
And on the way back home
Everything behind me
Is turning into stone

And I know it wasn't easy
How you had to let me go
But you know it won't be easy
To walk alone

And I know it wasn't easy
How you had to let me go
But you know it won't be easy
To walk alone, to walk alone
Has gone away, has gone away
