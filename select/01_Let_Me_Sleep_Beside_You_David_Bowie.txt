Baby, baby, brush the dust of youth from off your shoulder
Because the years of fretting days is right behind you now
Don't return to fields of green where rainbow secrets were told
Place your ragged doll with all the toys and things and deeds

Yeah, for I will show you game
Where the winner never wins

Let your hair hang down
Wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you

Lock away your childhood and throw away the key
Now the streets and city sights will burn your eyes as coals
We shall drink the oldest wine, velvet skies will linger
Child, you're a woman and your heart and soul are free, yeah

I will boldly light that lamp
But we shall walk together

Let your hair hang down
Wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you

Your darkened eyes throw mystery
But your lips are void of history
You could not imagine that it could happen this way
Could you?

I will give you dreams
Then I'll tell you things you'll like to hear

Let your hair hang down
Wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you

I said, let your hair hang down
Wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you
